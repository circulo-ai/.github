### Multi-Agent Intelligence for Next-Generation Conversations and Team Management

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for Circulo — a platform redefining how humans interact with AI through collaborative multi-agent systems.

Circulo transforms conversation into a dynamic, multi-perspective dialogue. Instead of a single model answering questions, Circulo brings multiple specialized AI agents together around a shared conversational space. Each agent contributes its own expertise, tools, personality, and reasoning style — producing richer insights, better decisions, and more trustworthy outcomes.

## 🚀 What We’re Building

Circulo is designed to be the foundation for multi-agent communication, offering:

* A unified conversation engine for orchestrating multiple AI agents.
* Role-based agent personalities with customizable expertise, tools and behavior.
* Embeddable multi-agent components for integrating Circulo into products.
* Developer-friendly APIs for building custom AI agent experiences.

## 🧠 Why Multi-Agent?

Traditional AI interfaces rely on one model serving all tasks.
Circulo takes a different approach:

* Diverse perspectives → More accurate and creative outcomes
* Specialization → Each agent can be an expert in its domain
* Collaboration → Agents debate, analyze, and refine answers
* Transparency → Users see the reasoning from multiple angles

We’re building the future of AI interaction — intelligent teams instead of solitary models.
